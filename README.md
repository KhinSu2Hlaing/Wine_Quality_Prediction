# Wine_Quality_Prediction
Introduction:
Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction Machine Learning Project! This project aims to predict the quality of wines based on various physicochemical features using machine learning techniques. This README file provides an overview of the project structure, data sources, dependencies, and instructions for running the code.

Project Structure:
 ‚Ä¢ README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
 ‚Ä¢ wine_quality_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
 ‚Ä¢ data/: Directory containing the dataset(s) used for training and testing the machine learning models.
 ‚Ä¢ saved_models/: Directory to store trained machine learning models for future use.
